# The benchmark group is for servers that will run benchmarks
# The controller group is for servers that will manage the benchmark servers

# If separate driver machines are to be used, add them to the "driver" group
# and then add a var to the benchmark host called "driver" with a value
# corresponding to the name of the driver host. Don't use the same driver for
# multiple hosts!!
#
# In the example below, server1 will be driven by server6, and server2 by
# server7. server3 and server4 will run HammerDB locally.
